## Redefine statistical significance
Benjamin, D.J., Berger, J.O., Johannesson, M. *et al*. Redefine statistical significance. Nat Hum Behav 2, 6â€“10 (2018). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-017-0189-z

This paper argues that simply increasing a cut-off $P$ value for statistical significance from 0.05 to 0.005 will help solve so-called reproducibility crisis in research. 

In testing a point null hypothesis $H_0$ against an alternative hypothesis $H_1$ based on data $x_{\text{obs}}$, the $P$ value is defined as the probability, calculated under the null hypothesis, that a test statistic is as extreme or more extreme than its observed value.

$$\frac{\text{Pr}(H_1|x_{\text{obs}})}{\text{Pr}(H_0|x_{\text{obs}})} = \frac{f(x_{\text{obs}}|H_1)}{f(x_{\text{obs}}|H_0)} \times 
\frac{\text{Pr}(H_1)}{\text{Pr}(H_0)} = \text{BF} \times \text{(prior odds)}$$
